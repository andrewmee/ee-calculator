# EE Calculator test

The start of a simple React calculator application as per [EE's Calculator problem](https://equalexperts.github.io/ee-tech-interviews-uk/calculator-problem.html) (version 3de1fa326e03a11e55932af6f9fcf288a362a61d).

To stay within a reasonable timeframe I tried to keep the code simple, abstraction to a minimum, and only implemented the +, =, and clear operations.

I also didn't do any work to capturing keyboard inputs or calculate on form submission.
